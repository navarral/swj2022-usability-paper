T1
	Information provided is enough
	Health events wording in the graphical figure
T2
	Login no problem
T3
	Events definition is not clear
	Map of the locations available
	time-window length and lag with information to clarify the meaniing
T4
	Collapse buttons function not clear
	Data provenance not clear at first
		Able to undestand the datasets used
	Data Lineage usefulness not mentioned
	Full metadata exploration
		Control+F searching find after mentioning arrows
	
T5
	Normally not normally distributed - 
	Column names fine and toggle too
	The table is useful for users that come from the health domain and 
	 it is intuitive to get the covariates needed for analysis
T6
	Fix lag x-axis
	Heatmap
		Not understand what the slider below is useful for
		Many events can be problematic to visualize
		Assess the significance overall selection with regard to the entire database for query relevance
	Boxplot
		Very useful
		Showcase by colour the diferent seasons
		Anomalies are more valuable for research than raw values
	Polarplot:
		typical polar plot relevant and nice and can be informative
	Time series plot highliting the points that are anomalies
	
	Include numeric input to filter/select specific values such as outliers
	Seasonality by computing monthly mean value
T7
	Comparison feasible
T8 
	Downloads fine and fast
	Useful data for research
T9
	Interesting approach 
	Info + plots for preliminary assessment for those covariates
	Easy to operate and export the datasets for further exploration
