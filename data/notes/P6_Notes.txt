	  Envo data		 | Event
T2
	Fine
T3
	"Envo" term not clear
	lag-length not clear
	Does not explore the (i) info
T4
	Bc of the zoomed view the participant struggles to find the
	 intro paragraph and the Q1 tab label
	DataSetsUsed hard to understand - maybe links or hover info?
	DataSetsUSed count fine
	Data lineage concept fine but not usable/understandable
	Does not collapse the buttons which difficults the overall
	 navigation and readability
T5
	lag-length comprehension issue
	table fine and (re)usable
T6
	Heatmap hard to understand:
		needs clarification and to fix X-axis units with the lag
		multiple events overlap
	Boxplot easier to understand
	Polar plot not clear bc it is not per event:
		needs clarification
T7
	Acknowledges that multiple inputs can happen
	Data sets are for one region+time not per event - how can I fix that
	Collapse buttons need a title to help navigation
T8
	Downloads everything fine
T9
	There is a lot of information to concentrate on
	Balance between volume of info and simple UI
	Clarify the lag-len
