T1
	Clicking the methodology link
	Home tab looks nice
	links to be a simple info with the definitons
	Visual helpful
T2
	No problem
T3
	Understands that multiple inputs are possible
	len-lag requires more thinking than the rest
		extra info could be useful to understand it better
	More info about envo data sets
T4
	Data provenance:
		Event name not clear
		datSetsUsed could be more clear
		Overall nice understanding
		Needs a heading
	Collapse function not completly clear
	Data Lineage:
		Takes the time to read it and understands the comment
		Query understood as code
		Technical info
	Full metadata exploration
		Understands categorization within the text
	Metadata fields found
		
T5
	NOXasNO2 not available
	Headings clear
	Eye option and toggle too
	Cell background colours fine
	Does not see the pages at first
	Event name understood now as general event
	Very useful data
T6
	Heatmap
		Interactive
		need to fix the lag
		Likes the plot
	Boxplot
		Likes the statistics in the boxplots
	PolarPlot
		Understands the plot and enjoyes it
	Specially likes and finds useful the heatmap bc of the patterns displayed
T7
	Explores all plots
	Comparison fix scales?
	Exploratory aspect great
	Maybe add summary statistics for all the events?
T8
	Exports useful and easy to use
	Download all fine
T9
	Home:
		methodology should be an example for the semantic methods
		KG should have a simple definition
	Query:
		Description to what are the events related to in the case study
	Understands that events are random
	Add clearer info from the datasets
	Simplyfied info for the metadata categories
	The rest is fine
	The main goal would is getting the data associated to individual events that share a category
	Export format nice
		Date only and not time if daily data is queried
		Add relative dates from the event next to the date -lag1,2,3
		Sorting the dates in reverse order
	Very useful for research
	Halff researchers time, saves
