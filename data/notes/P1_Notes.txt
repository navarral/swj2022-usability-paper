T1
	Yes, sensible info
	Scientific data to more specific, environmental data
T2
	Done before T1
T3
	Understands what example event are
	Sort events descending
	Sort location in alphabetical order
	Lag and length not clear - add tooltip
T4
	Does not realize they are collapse at first
	Data Lineage is not clear
	RDF not readable for the participant
	Prefers the table with less info
	Understands the number of datasets
	eg:DataUse comment not immediate
	eg:Identification risk write clearer
T5
	dateT not tooltip!
	NOXas no tooltip!
	Cannot find text paragraph for cell color
	Table seems fine but visualizations can be more useful
	likes that outliers are highlighted
	Some empty rows are blue, fix that
	discovers how to sort the rows but they are too small - increase width of columns
	dateTime a bit pedanting so only give the date without hours
T6
	Understands Heatmap
	Discovers interactivity
	Not sure of the slider underneath - useful for all of the events
	Try to fix when a single day the value is very high or low -outlier issue
	Boxplot: remove dots and add outliers bigger as a dot
	PolarPlot: likes it
	Add a histogram to complete the boxplot
	Basic time series over the variable does not realize the heatmap is the same
T7
	Answers the questions quickly
	Sort variables
	No additional features besides the ones mentioned in T6
T8
	Exports quikly
	Filenames are same, make them more clear
	Zip okay
	Data would be very useful
	Add all selection option - needs all data
T9
	Pretty nice
	Most of the things the participant wants
	Input everything at once
	Outliers not included in the Z-Scores computation
	Only one box open at a time
	Metadata useful
	Remove a query?
