T2
	Login fine
T3
	Events understood as flare categories
	Location where they are more
	length-lag needs help info not clear
	Confusion in time-window becomes clearer with the datatable
T4
	Data provenance
		where the data came from
		event heading to eventID
		chek if event day is lagged or not
		dataSetsUsed don't mean anything to the participant
			could fix that
	Collapse function needs headings for clarification otherwise confusing
	Data Lineage not
	Number of datasets understood as types of datasets - Confusion between data sources and data sets
	Full metadata exploration
		Not sure about the usefulness for a user 
		License is US not UK
	Display of code by default could be unnessary, print log instead of display
T5
	dateT has no tooltip
	Z-scores with NaN why do they appear in blue? - Empty blue squares
	Z-score is for all the values in the columns
	Z-score only calculated from the datatable values present

T6
	Boxplot
		Impresion of the raw values

T7
	Check message to be specific for EventType and Location
	Comparison between Queries straightforward

	General directions tab
		with time-window
	Z-scores can see the intend of the usefulness but the real usefulness might not be much
