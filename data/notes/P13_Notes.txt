T2
	Easy login
T3
	Different case studies useful
	Time-window length and lag not clear - needs clarification
	Query submited fine
T4
	DataSetsUSed not clear what is exaplained there - needs further clarification
	Event name not clear - number of observation for each case
	Data lineage: not that clear but it could be useful for a CS for reporting
	Full metadata exploration info findable but the RDF notation can be hard to tackle at first
T5
	dateT has no tooltip
	Select a specific range for a variable
	The datatable is useful for analysis but not that good for understanding the data itself
	Would like to add clinical data to the environmental at the same time
T6
	Need to fix lag and maybe better x-axis label
	HEatmap fine
	Boxplot
		Likes the interactive feature when hovering over
	Polarplot
		Not clear 
	Plot many variables at the same time as in ggplot
	Enjoys the plots to visualize the data
T7
	Metadata found faster than first time
	Both plots at the same time
T8 
	Donwloads are easy but datatable was hard to find
T9
	Extra information like demographics such as age and sex
	Adding clinical information and arregle the number of observation per case
