474,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Wording not clear,I am not exactly sure what all the images are for or whether they are there to help me.
475,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Home tab elements useful,I think that's everything I get that I get to be held to support to do my queries.

480,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,"Time window lag, so I think this means either side of that."
481,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,"(The participant reads the temporal unit tool tip) I don't know what that is. Oh sorry, maybe that is at those temporal windows there."
482,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,I am going to try to submit that but I am not doing something right.
483,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process clear,"No events, okay. I think I have ... Maybe if I change this."
484,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Let's see what I did there. Oh sorry, now I am getting this. Temporal units, I am gonna go by the day"
485,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Task sequence complex,So let me get back to my tasks. (The participant reads the task again)
486,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,I was not sure whether I was inputting a query.
487,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Maybe just something like enter a query, even though you have query inputs up there."
487,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional explanation,"Maybe just something like enter a query, even though you have query inputs up there."
488,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Export (meta)data useful,So this is my query and I was looking for definite events and here I have environmental information.
489,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Export (meta)data useful,(The participant reads the column heading descriptions from the data table)
489,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Task sequence complex,(The participant reads the column heading descriptions from the data table)
490,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional explanation,I am not sure what NOx means.

492,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"When I was reading it, I was expecting that the data provenance, lineage, use and limitations would have a button for each. So that surprised me a bit. I want to explore them now."
493,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Task sequence complex,Each of the three buttons but I got five buttons.
494,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"I am seeing example events Ireland, Wexford and 4 returns, so that is the provenance."
495,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"I am getting this information here, which I am not sure what it means."
496,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"Okay, here. So it is telling me where all the metadata is coming from I think."
497,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"FAIR metadata export, I think I am not getting how this is all changing. Let me just go back."
498,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"So that is the provenance, so when I close that it goes away. The same for the lineage and full metadata."
499,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"I would have expected not to have all of them appear at the same time, but when I click another one the previous would disappear."
500,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Maybe also a button to show them all together.
501,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Simple export,"FAIR metadata export, I am getting a file coming down here."
502,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,I still have this text area showing. Let's see ...
503,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Task sequence complex,Let's see ... (The participant reads the sub task again)
504,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"I think there was only one. Oh, no I better go back and take a look. How many data sets were used? Three data sets."
505,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search feature simple,"Okay, the data license is there and it is a creative commons license."
506,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,The data use is just rdfs:comment. It is an rdfs about the data use but not telling me anything about it
510,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search feature simple,"I have to ask about the identification, so this should be an interesting one. Where is my identification risk? Okay, so the information seems to be here but it may be better to have it summarized in a better particular way so that you can expand it in more detail. If I want to go further."
511,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Okay, so the information seems to be here but it may be better to have it summarized in a better particular way so that you can expand it in more detail. If I want to go further."
509,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search information process complex,"Okay, so I can't find the risk. MODERATOR: Do you want to try to use Control+F? Oh, you told me that. I am using Control+F but it is not doing anything. MODERATOR: Control+F opens a little box on the top and you can type what you want to look for? Okay, so risk."
572,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Do you want to try to use Control+F?
573,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Control+F opens a little box on the top and you can type what you want to look for?
512,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search information process complex,So this has risk ... Data sets storage ... I am not getting an understanding of what the risk is. MODERATOR: Maybe you could use the arrows in the Control+F search box at the top right corner of your screen.
574,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Maybe you could use the arrows in the Control+F search box at the top right corner of your screen.
513,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search information process complex,"Okay, now I got some description here now. It took me a while to find that. There is something there that is telling me. So my answer is that it could be just clearer or I could be faster."
514,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"Now I am going to click on these extra buttons and I am going to get rid of that one, ups. I don't know why that happened."
515,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"So do I understand the columns? (The participant reads the column heading descriptions) So yes, they are clearly the ones I got there. If I am an expert in all of those things, I would know."
516,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Maybe if I am an expert I would like to know more information, maybe ranges or something if that is relevant."
517,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"So yes, I guess I can find this information."
519,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"So I am not told. Instinctively, I would say that the red ones are warnings or that they are higher of a particular range of something. The blue ones might be lower then."
518,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Maybe the range would have been nice to have up here if that is the case.
518,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional explanation,Maybe the range would have been nice to have up here if that is the case.
520,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,So we can hide them. I am not quite sure where the toggle columns button is but I can use the little eye to do that.
521,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"I suppose ... but wait, how do I get the hidden columns back? I don't know if I have them all displayed now because I got rid of some of them."
522,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,Maybe I go and I do this. I am not sure how I am going to get them back or maybe they are all there because I don't remember. Oh no because I don't have the event column.
523,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Data table features useful,"MODERATOR: Maybe try the toggle columns button. Oh, very good. Now I found it. Okay, so I am making them disappear, not making them appear. Okay I got all the columns now. Okay, so that is obvious to me now and that is a handy feature."
523,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"MODERATOR: Maybe try the toggle columns button. Oh, very good. Now I found it. Okay, so I am making them disappear, not making them appear. Okay I got all the columns now. Okay, so that is obvious to me now and that is a handy feature."
575,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Maybe try the toggle columns button.
526,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Wording not clear,I didn't notice these up here. I don't remember seeing that before
525,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Data table features useful,"(The participant reads the data background paragraph). Okay, so the red are high and the blue are low, so what I expected them to be."
527,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"So now, Can I make sense now? is my question. So I have an event with a particular name and I have all of this data here. I am understanding that on this particular day this event occurred and these are all the environmental factors that happened there. These are now all linked together from different data sets."
530,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,I did have three data sets but I am not sure which environmental variable comes from which data sets but I know that they are linked.
528,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"So, maybe the data set that it came from might be a useful thing to know. I don't know how you can mark them but that would be something useful."
529,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"Maybe, these ones being red, I don't know about the significance of them being red but maybe that is up to the user to interpret that. I can see that these are red for the data set for that column and that event. But what does it mean for the event? is the whole row affected or is there a way of signaling that row instead of just the cell?"
532,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Visualization useful,This data table with all of these events that occurred on the previous slide. Now I am hearing relative time from the event (day). Relative for the event (day) ... Relative time from the event day -2 and event-530 and the range is there.
531,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Event concept and approach not clear,"So again, if there was a high and maybe this would come across, but it would be nice to see why I am getting these events or maybe it is all that it exists."
534,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Visualization useful,"I am going to pick rain. Okay so I just got four events here and I had four events there. Then, I have four events there. So there are four events."
533,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,So the events are in different orders in all of the screens.
535,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Plot design complex,I am not sure what these types of things are used for.
536,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Plot design complex,I am not sure if the events are supposed to be associated with this or this are just for the time range that I am in.
537,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Task sequence complex,It is loading up and I am going to read the tasks again. (The participant reads the task again)
538,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I wonder if it would be nice that you could look at a collective of the three of them together maybe for 1 event if that was useful. For example, if you were to choose event-58, you could get three plots together for that event. I think I would like to add on this as well what the data sets were that contributed to this."
539,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,So I think that the data sets would be interesting to see and maybe something about the color coding on what the different things mean. I would say you would get used to it quite quickly with all the different symbols once you started using it.
539,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional explanation,So I think that the data sets would be interesting to see and maybe something about the color coding on what the different things mean. I would say you would get used to it quite quickly with all the different symbols once you started using it.
540,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Overall positive experience,"Back to it now, so I am used to this by now."
542,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I will input a new query for Ireland but this time I am going to look at no events.
548,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I will go for 2 days and I got that ...
543,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,"Okay, so I have 23 data sets here ... Oh sorry, no data available."
544,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,So I am going to add Mayo in the locations. I am not getting any data ... Oh because I already got definite up there.
541,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,Okay so the events I am looking for are no events in all of these places ... Why am I not getting to input the temporal unit?
545,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,"Oh sorry, that is just telling me there. I was getting confused between two things here and the two things there."
546,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,"This is just giving me information I think. So I have 20 and I don't need all of them, let's remove ... Okay, it is still saying that. I am going to submit this ... Mmmm. MODERATOR: Maybe try clicking data availability. Oh yes, that is right, very good. So Now I get the temporal unit and the aggregation method."
578,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Maybe try clicking data availability.
547,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,So I am going for days and mean again.
549,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,So the last one I got 3 data sets and I have 3 data sets now. The data sets are all the same for all of the events. It looks like there are 3 data sets again for all of those events.
2321,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,So the last one was created commons. So I need to get rid of data provenance and then go to this button. I should then have a window here to search for the license.
2322,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search information process complex,Ups ... How do you spell license? Okay I am struggling now where this license is but I am determined.
577,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Maybe you can read one of the previous tasks to find out were the license was the first time.
2323,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search information process complex,Maybe I just say that I cannot find it.
2324,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"Okay, so that was in the full metadata exploration."
551,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Search feature simple,I can see that this is creative commons. So I did not read the other one properly but I do know it was creative commons but I can't remember the type of creative commons license because I didn't pay attention there. I only read the creative commons piece.
552,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Data table features useful,I think Q2 might have more but again I did not pay attention to that but I think I can find that out easily.
553,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"It might be interesting to see about those types of things, like the license, to have a little icon to say things like what is the license, the identification use. You know like a little symbol on it. That would be better than having to go in and look."
555,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Visualization useful,I am going to look at the heat map and select rain again. So I have got more events in this than I had in the other one. I am not really sure of what the differences are in terms of the data. I am not thinking of the data when trying to compare as it is not my area of information. I did not pick up a pattern in the last one. I can compare here.
556,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I wonder because you are asking me about comparing queries, I wonder if it would have been nice to see more than one query on at the same time."
557,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,If that is something that is ... I suppose that then you would have to have many information about the different queries even though we are here. We would probably have to show them on the right hand side as well.
558,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Task sequence complex,I think I did that already but I can go back to the first query and have a look at it.
559,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Simple export,Okay so I did that.
560,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,"How do I open this now? Okay, so I can see it there."
576,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: No problem, you can go ahead, no need to explore that."
561,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Simple export,I think I also did that.
562,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional explanation,I am not sure what I am getting when downloading it all. Is it just for this particular query or it is just for the two queries I did? So maybe add something that tells me which query I am downloading.
563,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Yes, I think the way it is formatted with the export I can see that it is in a format it would be useful to input. There are a lot of details in there that would be useful in there that would be useful to input into another research."
565,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Overall positive experience,"Okay, so I don't think I got stuck too badly."
564,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Navigation complex,I am just looking at the screen here and I didn't pick up that the Q1 and Q2 were there. I could have flicked between the two queries. I wasn't aware that this was available to me.
566,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Overall positive experience,"Overall, I don't think I got stuck too badly on the first go with content I wouldn't be extremely familiar with. I mean I know about the concept but I am not used to the data or type of plots that would be use. I think this dashboard would be a type of user interface I could get used to."
567,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Overall positive experience,"It was quite quick and I was able to ... Once I found the buttons, I got used to using the buttons and I think I will be able to navigate it quite quickly."
568,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,The only comment then would be in terms of icons on tables or maybe doing a combination of things but that is up to the researchers what they actually would find useful in combining.
569,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Maybe more visibility around the characteristics of each plot or the data sets in terms of putting icons around the provenance or identification risk or something like that, as well as being able to find it. Just some summary, so as long as the summary was able to capture all of the nuances of the information behind. You don't want to give somebody a false sense of security if something is of low risk if it isn't. I know all that has to be taken into account."
570,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Overall positive experience,"Overall, I think the right hand side was very useful, even though I missed some things, which I did not know why I missed them."
571,P2_GMT20211119.odt,Query process complex,The left hand side I think I was getting a bit confused on the order to do the things in. Whether I had to check this data availability or when I could submit etcetera. That one maybe would be the one you would not get used to. Maybe there is a sequence that is out of place there.
579,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Home tab elements useful,I am going to check what a knowledge graph is. I don't know if you can see my screen but I have to log in here as well. I think with the same credentials as before. I will check that later.
580,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Home tab elements useful,"Okay, this all makes sense to me."
581,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Home tab elements useful,I think I could understand all that is here

595,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Mmmm ... Interesting ... I guess the definite events are confirmed cases of something, example events, like a disease let's say. These events are not biologically confirmed but suspected somehow. These events are discarded. I am a weird person and I am going to choose the no, those that probably had a clinical form similar to what you would expect for this disease but then it was a no and it is something else."
596,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query process complex,I am not very familiar with Ireland so I am going to go with Cork in the south.
598,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Time window length (days) ... I guess it is the window of days that I want the data.
597,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I guess the lag is the lag of the data with respect to the clinical data ... I am not going to put a lot of lag.
599,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query process clear,Temporal unit ... I have to first check if the data is available.
600,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Ah okay, now I have to choose this temporal unit. (The participant reads the temporal unit tool tip)"
601,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query process clear,"Okay, so this is an aggregation process that goes internally."
602,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query process complex,"The aggregation method, this is hard to let the user choose this, maybe. Depends on the variable I guess. Interesting. I am going to put ... For me it is a bit confusing as I would like to know what sort of variables I am going to be selecting because I don't know."
603,P3_GMT20211125.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I am going to select the mean as it makes general sense.

726,P4_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"That being said I would like this option to be variable specific so we could input a dictionary. For example, if it was precipitation I would like the sum but if it is for temperature I would like the mean as the sum of the temperatures doesn't make a lot of sense. Since this is a variable specific factor I would like to have them like this in default but having the possibility to go into more advanced settings. If you want to open more advanced settings to specify for each of the variables."
727,P4_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"At this point I don't know the variables I am getting, which I think would also make sense before I decide on the aggregation method.

The same as this. That is weird. Maybe since missing values could exist, maybe a proper category for these values. Same here, missing values should not be included in the distributions and get Z-scores. Either add a different background for missing values, a gray one or something, or at least do not compute them as anything. I don't know if they are taken as zeros but they shouldn't. It should be clear that whenever any aggregation is done later from this, they should not be taken into account."

Then, we can show a scatter plot for those ones that are not. So we can show the plot not by event or the box plot not by event but by category. I think that is the most useful visualization you can have. It is interesting to see the distribution of the events of the same condition or category like those that were certain. But what you are interested is comparing controls against treatment, or healthy against disease events. So usually that is what you would want to do. That is what I would miss. That being said this can be done afterwards. So if I had to ask for something I would ask for that."

We see that the median for event-no has a median of 9.475 and the median for the events that were with high probability were 10.13 and 10, which is a clear indication that PM2.5 is causing the high probability events so we should do something about it (joking)."

Maybe it is an acronym that is important but if it is I don't know what it means. But maybe that is not important."
829,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,A record of the different counties and then the different event dates. We have like a timestamp 2014 ten past three in the morning. We have a set of data sets that relate to Dublin for this event type and event. I am seeing multiple data sets used here. Whereas for the other entries it seems like less data sets are used ... Oh no that is not true there are more data sets here.
830,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Query process complex,"Yeah, I will keep going but I am not entirely sure what I am looking at here. sure you can clarify pretty quicker but at the same time I should be able to look at this and understand it myself directly. Then, I wouldn't be hugely confident that I could say exactly what is going on. So I guess the thing that is a little bit confusing is that there are multiple data sets here. I guess I am sort of expecting, what I am expecting to see as default from my own experience is one data set used entry per row entry in this data table but we got multiple data entries. I guess this is just redundant and it is the same information over time. But typically that is what you would see in a standard spreadsheet or what I am used to seeing anyways."

Okay, that makes me kind of wonder if this relates to a specific event, which meets certain criteria that was specified, why are there multiple data sets and how do they relate to each other. That would not be obvious to me. I can see that it is blank here as well for this entry and I am not entirely sure for some entries then it is not included so it is hard to. It is not entirely clear to be what it is going on but I guess I understand the basic format here but it is a bit elusive to me."

832,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Export (meta)data useful,I do not see any colors on this but we have references to an event. I can see how we can relate the data provenance table to the data table. This is obviously an event in Meath. There are other ones as well like event-526 on different days. So I guess there was some kind of lag that I was asking for. Maybe this is related to that.

835,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: If you don't mind going back to completing the previous task as this is the following one?
836,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Navigation complex,"Let me just double check. Data lineage ... Is this the same information as before? So data lineage, I am not sure what I am looking at now. Sorry I got confused or something. Data provenance and if I click data lineage the bottom box just closed. So I think this is the data provenance tab and I have discussed what I think is going on here."
837,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"(The participants reads the text in the data lineage window) I can see here it says a query to construct the data set, so I think it is SPARQL query code that is explaining what is going on."
838,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"So I don't know anything about SPARQL but it looks like I can kind of see how these query languages work with the bindings, select and these. So I can kind of speculate about what is going on here. But I don't think this is something that I would give particularly scrutiny as a non expert. Especially, if you have some concern that the query that you put in on the table does not correspond to what it's coming out in the output. You are familiar with the language then you might go through and check what is going on. For me I can't say much more than that."
839,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Navigation complex,"Sorry, just scrolling down. I wonder if I should close the others, yeah okay, that is nice."
840,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,So I mean what is going on here is that you are sort of a big file that is explaining where you are pulling all the information from I guess. The things you are talking about here like the themes with URL references. These are kinds of definitions for the different data sets. I guess you got these kinds of prefixes here that link with those references so I guess that is where it comes from.
841,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"So again, I guess the data comes out of a magic box so for me I would be happy that this information is all correct. If there was any concern I guess you got to a certain point to search for it and understand what is going on. Something like these geometries that are the coordinates of the different regions to figure out where the events happen. I guess you can use that to try to figure out if everything makes sense. But I mean at first glance, it wouldn't be the first thing that you would be looking at but its is good to know that it is there as a background resource."
842,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,So I think I am looking in the data provenance table so I am just looking through this. I can see that we got data sets used here and that you can look through that to see what is going on.
843,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"My question is then this, possibly I had said that before in another task. The thing that I am wondering is if the data sets are unique or you would use the same data set twice or something like that. I can see some data sets have an EEA and some that have MET so I guess it is querying Met Éireann or something like that. So presumably those are two different data sets anyway. If I go over the different rows, you wouldn't have the same data set twice, which I don't know if this makes sense. I guess I am not sure since you go from entry to entry. Well I can see in fact that these two are the same."
844,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"(The participant checks other data sets used to see if they are repeated through the events) Let me so ... 20 data sets for this event, which I guess that they are different. I am not going to do that again but I have lost count but I was around 21."
845,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: No problem, you can go ahead."
846,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Query process complex,I can say I don't know if I answered the question or if I am looking at this in the right way. I don't know what you can take from that but the answer could be no. Maybe that is because of the query that I set up.
847,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Search feature simple,"I think this is the data set use comment but I don't see much here. Let me see if there is anything else. There are only a couple of matches. (The participant reads the data use comment) Let me now try the identification risk. Probably I should have copied and pasted that but anyway. (The participant reads the identification risk comment) I think that is fine, I am happy with that. So pretty clear about that."
848,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Navigation complex,So let me look through this now and I will close that one.
849,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Task sequence complex,(The participant reads the sub task again)
850,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Export (meta)data useful,(The participant reads the column heading descriptions)
851,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Task sequence complex,I don't know if you would like me to go over all of these.
852,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional explanation,Oh this one does not have a description
853,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Export (meta)data useful,but for the most part these are very clear so I am happy with that.
854,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Data table features useful,"So this is explained, the principle for sure, but I don't see any values here but I wonder if I change the entries here. So I can see some red values here, the red are the high values. Okay I can see some entries here but these were missing before but it seems like a low value. I guess compared to the other ones 17.5 seems high. So yeah I am very happy that I understand that, that is very clear."
855,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Data table features useful,"Yeah that is fine although it is not clear to me how I can get them back. That was one of the questions, oh by using the toggle columns button. Okay, okay that is fine and really easy to use."
856,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Navigation complex,Yeah that is fine although it is not clear to me how I can get them back.
857,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I guess the big thing is that it is being divided into smaller regions. I would just make the table bigger, stretching in an out,that would be easier to look at more data at once."
858,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,There are going to be issues with missing data depending on the type of data that we have. So here we would only have a small amount. I don't know how easy this can be but toggling in and out of the missing data. Maybe you could pick the columns and pick the missing ones and get a much more complete picture.
859,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Data table features useful,I think the other features that you have there are very helpful to give you a scan of what is going on. Especially before you export the data you want to make sure that everything looks okay. So that would be the only thing I would say.

860,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Visualization useful,Let me look at the temperature. I am probably not clever enough to know what is going on with the other environmental data anyway. We have 6 events and I guess I asked for them daily. I can make sense of this data. This is pretty clear. Event-147 was very warm as we were seeing blue the whole time and that other one the opposite being very cold.
861,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Plot design complex,This box below I don't think what is going on to be honest.
862,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Plot design complex,Relative time from the event ... I don't know what that means.
863,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional explanation,"I know that sometimes it is useful to have a couple of complementary maps but I would need some content to explain what is going on here. I can't figure it out based on that information. At a glance it looks like it has the same or similar heat map twice so I am not sure. Yeah, I am not sure what is going on here."

864,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Visualization useful,I know what is going on here as this is very clear.
865,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Oh yeah, these are very pretty. It would be nice if the events would be ordered in the same way between plots. It would be interesting to compare, is it possible to do that? I don't think it has happened here."
866,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Visualization useful,"what I would take again from it is that I asked for a 30 day window length not lag, isn't it? What you can kind of see is that the data is skewed. Event-265 had moderate temperatures but there was a lot of rain around that event. So you can see the mean overall is higher but for this it was kind of skewed but you know the rainfall didn't seem to change except for event-256. Is the fact that there is no data here or the fact that there is no data. It looks like it is just missing. That wasn't a particularly warm day. so I don't think that was an issue or something like that."
867,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Plot design complex,"For event-147 the rain was actually, oh no I am looking at the wrong day. For event-526, it is just missing that information but the temperature is missing too. So it is not appearing for the heat map. That is a bit surprising for me that, well that is maybe an internal setting but that is something you can fix fairly easily. Maybe it just needs to be a check for that."
868,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Visualization useful,Certainly the plots are pretty easy to read and if you hover over you could see what the entries are along the way.
869,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Visualization useful,So I think that looks good to me.
870,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Task sequence complex,I think I am being picky because I have taken too long to talk about this stuff.
871,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional explanation,So it says here wind direction and speed. Is that what is going on here? It is telling me what the temperature was like in relation to the wind direction and speed that is associated with this. I was not entirely sure what I was going to see here. I guess that I would need this to be explained to me.

872,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional explanation,That it was being used in relation to another variable. I am not sure what I was expecting to be honest with you for this. But it seems like you got cold events associated with strong northerly winds and warmer events associated with south-westerly winds. I wouldn't be 100% confident that I interpreted that right but it is what it seemed to me.

874,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,There are a lot of things that you can do. You would have to think about a histogram to look at the distribution even though the box plots kind of cover that.
875,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Maybe a scatter plot so you can start to look at more than one variable at the same time.
876,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,There are so many to choose from so it is worth discussing it. I don't have an obvious one from the top of my head I guess. Maybe if you wanted to look at a couple of different relationships that would be helpful. A time series plot for all of the events at the same time that might be useful to see. Those are the things from the top of my head.
878,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Task sequence complex,(The participant starts reading task 8)

882,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I am quite reluctant to change the time window length by very much but maybe I can reduce the lag. Maybe I will make the time window length a bit smaller. I don't want to play around too much with that.
883,P5_GMT20211125.odt,System issue,"I think that is running. MODERATOR: It is actually not running, you need to check if data is available first. Oh sorry, I forgot to press that button. Okay, perfect. (The participant reads the task again) MODERATOR: I got a critical error from the memory. So that is why it is not working. What do you think I should do? MODERATOR: Maybe just choose one location and choose for example 5 days for the time window length so we can get through. If not we will have to refresh the page. Okay. MODERATOR: So you got Q3, so we will have to do with that. You won't have Q2 anymore. So query 3 okay."

889,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"Right, where do I find that out? It wasn't clear to me if it was in the data lineage or in the full metadata exploration. Okay, dct:license, which I forgot to check on the last one."

892,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Search feature simple,"Okay, yeah no that is fine. It looks like it is the same one creative commons by-sa/4.0. Okay that is the same one. I certainly found it in both places. I was a bit lazy in terms of checking it."
893,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Data table features useful,"So this case record seems to be a bit more complete for the variables I am looking at here. Certainly I can see more blues and reds in general. So it is hard to compare as this query has some issues regarding the completeness of the data. But I think I am seeing more colors for the second data set for query 3. I can see some but it does not seem to be as many. That would suggest that for whatever reason, it is a bit tricky to say but I think query 3 has more."
894,P5_GMT20211125.odt,System issue,"Okay so let me pick where I am actually confident in what is going one. But equally I am more tempted to do the polar plot to see if I can make more sense of it. Oh, no. MODERATOR: I think you won't be able to do this part as one of the queries broke which affected the index of the plots. So you cannot do this part because it broke before. Oh sorry, that's a pity. I guess I will have to move on."
895,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Plot design complex,But equally I am more tempted to do the polar plot to see if I can make more sense of it.

897,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I guess some raw information would be useful like how many data points my query resulted in and how many missing values per column that would be kind of useful information to know.
898,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Then, if you could have some way to combine the queries but I would need to think about that one more. I think it could be interesting to say whether I have more data in Q1 than Q3 or you could combine line plots in the same part to see if the pictures are similar or not. Like you know if you had two queries and the pictures are separated you know if something is going on or if thy are broadly similar. So something like that I guess."
899,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Simple export,I guessed I clicked the export and left it in the downloads folder.

904,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Then, the other information, frankly, I would like to talk to you guys about what is considered best practices but potentially it will be helpful to have it saved somewhere, in case I need it for my records or something like that. But is it something that I would directly check myself and say oh I need to check this, that is not something I would use. But that is not to say that is not important. I appreciate that it could be quite important. Especially in a collaborative project you know. In this kind of EU project we participate to keep track of what we are doing so I can appreciate the importance from that point of view. But I don't see how I would use it directly."
905,P5_GMT20211125.odt,Overall positive experience,I think the short answer is that it is a pretty positive experience.

So the fact that there is some background information that lets you think about what is involved is quite helpful to check what is going on there. So that could be useful."

1122,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,I mean visualizations are always better to understand the data instead of a bunch of numbers.

I noticed that for O3 too. There are a lot of missing values here and these values are highlighted for some reason which is a little bit odd. I guess what it might be happening is that for these missing values it is substituting them by zero or something. Then, it comes out as an outlier. So, I think it is fine that these are empty but if they are missing these probably should not be included in the outlier calculation. That's one thing you can fix."
1125,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Data table features useful,"I think this is fine, just highlighting the outliers that is a good idea."
1126,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Also, having this tooltips is a good idea."
1127,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional explanation,It might be a good idea to have the tooltips for all of them because yeah this one is missing for example.
1128,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Data table features useful,There is also an arrow button to order the columns when clicked. It is sorting the rows by increasing values of this variable. I can also order them in descending order.
1129,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,The arrows could be a bit bigger because it is easy to accidentally click on the eye icon.
1130,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Data table features useful,This is a good idea and you can order them back.
1131,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,It might be nice if these arrows would be a bit bigger.
1132,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional explanation,"Maybe adding tooltips for some of them because they are missing, even if it is obvious for the sake of completeness I suppose."
1133,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Data table features useful,Highlighting the outliers is a good idea
1134,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Navigation complex,just to make sure you are not highlighting missing values.
1135,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Data table features useful,"Other than that I think yeah, good idea."

1136,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Yeah, like I said. Make these arrows bigger and complete the tool tips. I am not sure if there is anything else I would add."
1137,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Maybe this is a little bit pedantic, but if I have only asked for days, it may be a good idea to format the date appropriately. You are giving me the time here, which corresponds to midnight. If I just want every hour, it makes sense. If I want days, you can maybe format the dates to the day without the actual time, just getting the literal date."
1138,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Data table features useful,Other than that I think it is pretty good.

1140,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"I have selected PM10 and there is the heat map. We have a legend here with a gradient of colors. Lower values of PM10 are yellow and high values are dark blue. Then, you have a row for each event. This is the time window I have asked for."
1141,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,The graphs are interactive so that is good.
1142,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"If I hover over this box here ... Relative time from the event day -19 for event-147 and then it gives me the exact value 18.8, which is around the middle and it makes sense. That is nice."
1143,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Plot design complex,This smaller heat map underneath it just seems the same heat map as above. I am not sure the usefulness of this or what it is for.
1144,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"I will select a different one. Okay, yeah. This is nice."
1145,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"We have some very extreme values that are throwing off the gradient here. Along here it is hard to tell the differences because we have a pretty massive event compared to the other. I wouldn't know from the top of my head how you can fix that, you could try and put a maximum color gradient for the outliers. This is kind of awkward to deal with sometimes when you have outliers. You might want to think about the heat map in the presence of outliers. You have this behavior where the colors kind of blend together. Even though by its own scale this should be more distinct, because we have this massive value it is throwing off all the gradient."
1146,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Plot design complex,I just don't really know the purpose of the bottom plot as it seems like the same heat map but compressed.
1147,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Plot design complex,"I may get the usefulness of this if I had more events. If I had 20 events, I would have this huge yolk, it is just a more compressed view of it. It would be more useful if we had more events, it is like a smaller heat map. Maybe this is okay. This is fine."
1148,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,You can look into resolving the outlier issue.
1149,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,Okay yeah. Again it is nice that the graph is interactive. It is telling us where the quantiles are and the exact values.
1150,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,So that is nice for event-147 and event-143. I guess these are the quantiles within the time window.
1151,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"We have these massive outliers. Well a massive outlier, that is nice."
1152,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I think personally, you know this isn't like universal advice. I personally don't like the data points down here and if you have the outliers just put them in the graph. My issue here is that you have this point here , which is very hard to see, very small points. I would personally get rid of the data points. I would just have the box plots and really large points for the outliers. But again some statisticians like to have the data points so you don't have to take this advice as the court law."
1153,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"Anyway, I like box plots. It is a good idea."
1154,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"Yeah, we saw this in the last experiment. I remember I said I had never seen these type of plots before. This looks at wind speed in each direction and then it gives you the mean PM10, the average PM10 for that wind speed. It is a good idea."
1155,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,So the color tells you ... When we had a north-eastern wind of 10 miles/hour values tend to be higher. We can see that south-eastern winds the value of PM10 was much lower. This is actually quite nice. It is really nice. I had never seen this before myself. It is a really nice way of visualizing data.
1156,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,It is this kind of plot that you have to look at them for a second to understand what is going on. I think that is fine. So yeah.
1157,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"Let's look at SO2. So the outlier is missing from this graph it seems ... Anyway, we do see a pretty clear correlation between PM10 and the wind speed which maybe it is expected but I don't know much about environmental stuff. Maybe it is obvious but I don't know. Yeah you would expect that with rain, so that is cool."
1158,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Maybe a histogram. It is nice to give them alongside with box plots since it tells you if there are any peaks in the data. A box plot can't really tell you that but a histogram will so it is nice to have those as well.
1159,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Yeah just, I guess the only other thing is the time series plot. Just the basic time series plot. Just a line graph of the variable over the time window you know. That would be nice as well. A basic time series plot of the variable."
1162,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Okay, let's say I just want to see the none events in Dublin. Well not in Dublin, in Wicklow."
1163,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Let's pick a big number of 100 days with no lag.
1164,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Query process clear,So there are 2 events and 1 environmental data set.
1167,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Let's say over 100 days, so that is kind of a long period ..."
1166,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Yeah let's select the minimum in the aggregation method.
1168,P1_GMT20211118.odt,System issue,I don't know if this is a glitch but this stuff popped up. I am guessing that is not supposed to happen.
1169,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,So Q2 only uses 1 data set and the Q1 used 20 data sets
1170,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Search feature simple,"So that was dct:license, so I think so. I remember creative commons. This is right by-sa/4.0 I can't remember the exact stuff here but it was creative commons."
1171,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Navigation complex,Let me get rid of the full metadata text.
1172,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Data table features useful,"We only have one environmental data set so obviously Q1, as Q2 has only O3."
1173,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Navigation complex,Is there a way to directly compare. Oh I see I see. I did not see the query tabs up there before.
1174,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,It opens new tabs so you can directly compare them. So yeah obviously. I did not need to check for this particular.
1175,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Navigation complex,Query ... hold on let me just check something. So the data provenance table was open again so I don't know if this is a glitch or something I did.
1176,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,I can see that the tabs have opened up so that is nice to compare them.
1177,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Task sequence complex,(The participant reads the sub task again)
1178,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Navigation complex,Okay yeah this might be better if they were in an alphabetical order. I am not sure about this ordering but it is better alphabetical.
1179,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Visualization useful,"For Q1 only one of the events has an associated O3 value, so this is a high probability event where O3 values are between 25 and 47. The O3 values for none events are very different but it is also another part of the country. This is Wicklow and the other one is Dublin. It is kind of interesting that for the high probability events data is much more spread out than it is here in Q2. These two events in Q2 might have lived in different parts of Wicklow as well."
1180,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"It is probably a lot of work to make it nice and easy but maybe if you could add more grouped box plots. If there is a way to compare O3 and ... Maybe not actually, hold on. Maybe not. I don't know how useful it would be. I think it would be a lot of work for something that wouldn't be so useful."
1181,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"This is fine, I would like to see a histogram and a time series plot. These would be the main things really."
1182,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Simple export,This is the data and this the metadata.
1183,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Navigation complex,"It is saved as a ttl file, which I have no idea what is either the rdf file for the data."

1185,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Navigation complex,"I have just noticed that the data provenance table and the data table are automatically saved with the same name as default. Maybe use more informative names like data_prov and data_table, which would be more clear."
1186,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Yeah, so the files are the data tables for each query. Okay, that is useful."
1187,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Export (meta)data useful,That seems fine.
1188,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Yeah, I mean I think so. I wouldn't see why not. This would be very useful for me because this is pretty much the exact data I need."
1189,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Additional feature suggestion,So for me I would want all of the events for all of the locations. So I guess one thing you can do ... If I was to use this and I wanted to export I would want all of these for my particular research. Using the drop down to add in all the locations and events is pretty time consuming so if there was a way to add them all at once. Maybe there is already an option but it would be nice to add all of them somehow.
1190,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Export (meta)data useful,I mean this is the whole thing. This is exactly what we want to select by the time window.
1191,P1_GMT20211118.odt,Export (meta)data useful,Very useful.

Because you need to select the aggregation method separately, you either choose mean or maximum and minimum.

So why did I think there were 4 events, I must have missed that ... there is event-490 ... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (the participant is counting the events) ...

No, I cannot deal with all of that. Once I've dealt with all of this it would be quite nice to get rid off all of this because it is a bit in my way. But okay, yeah okay, so ..."
1481,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"So I am going to do a heat map of the rain Okay so here are my six events and my 8 days running up to the time of the event. Yeah I get that, these are the days and these are the events."
1482,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"This seems to be a squashed version of this essentially, which would be good if there would be a lot of events."
1483,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"I am afraid it does not tell me much of the use of the impact of the rain for these events, probably because the time length is too short. But anyway, that seems perfectly acceptable."
1484,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"This is telling me that presumably in the 8 days leading up to the event-418 there was a very cold temperature ... but there is quite a variation in temperatures, which is typical of Ireland, isn't it? Well for the event-418 for the person event-418, whereas for the event-490 happens after a very narrow temperature variation. I don't think I need to say much more about that one."
1486,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,Uh lovely. Polar plots are good for wind direction and speed and I did not pick wind speed or wind direction so let me go back in a second.
1487,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Plot design complex,"Now that I remember what a polar plot is, okay. I don't see wind speed or direction there and that is probably because you have just done it."
1488,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"So, what is this doing? I guess this is the total, 8 times 6 so 48 data wind speed and directions for the 8 days leading to the events. If you were not a statistician you might say that there is some pattern going on here but I guess that we are in Ireland and most of the weather comes from the west and south-west. The strongest winds come from the south and south-west and that is why none of these people had an event after a north-eastern wind because that is very rare. Yeah, helpful information if there was more data that would be useful, I guess."
1485,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Plot design complex,"Slightly relevant that the polar plot is only relevant if you have wind direction and speed, and I did not pick that up after I had picked up dew point temperature. But that's okay."
1489,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Maybe trends but no, because we think that the environmental impact on weather is probably happening at the time, it could be because there was a change. So changes on these variables over a period of time but I am not an expert in this so I don't know how you would visualize that"
1491,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Okay let's go for a different county
1492,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,let's have a longer time window
1490,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Well no, let's go for another time unit like hours to have a bit of variety."
1493,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query process clear,"Okay, I thought it said earlier that I could choose another time window here ... Oh I need to check data availability first."
1497,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Oh lots more data sets! Because it was Dublin, oh was planning to take Galway out but that might be the answer. So maybe I leave Galway out, so let's check for data availability. No data for Dublin, that's surprising."
1496,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I will change this one as well and select more event types.
1494,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,It looks like I can add counties here which I haven't anticipated so let's just do Cork and Galway.
1495,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: If you could reduce the events or the locations as it is too much for the memory
1498,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,So as far as I can make out all of my events used 4 data sets so I will have to check on the second one. Okay so the answer to the first one is that his one is using more data sets. Oh no you wanted the event that was using the most but I suspect all of the events will be using the same amount of data sets.
1499,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I was going to change this to hours but I probably end up regretting that. Let me go back and change this. Okay now I have 24 hours per one.
1501,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Okay so hours and mean.
1500,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Task sequence complex,So I am going to read back the tasks in a second while this loads. (The participant reads the tasks again)
1503,P10_GMT20211130.odt,System issue,"Okay, so here there's the data and I need to find the full metadata exploration. MODERATOR: We got an exceeding memory issue, let's refresh the dashboard and quickly submit two queries again. Okay sure, oh query 1 is still up there I did not notice that. That was not immediately obvious to me so there is something to remember. I am going to refresh and submit the two queries then."
1504,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: We got an exceeding memory issue, let's refresh the dashboard and quickly submit two queries again."
1502,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Navigation complex,"Okay sure, oh query 1 is still up there I did not notice that. That was not immediately obvious to me so there is something to remember."
1505,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Query process clear,"So we have fewer data sets related to Wexford than Galway, which I do not know why this happens but we can come back at it another day."
1506,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Navigation complex,Okay so now we have Q1 and Q2. I would have missed this bit that there were multiple queries across the top here.
1507,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,The data provenance suggests that there are 3 data sets here in Q2 while there were 4 for the other ones.
1508,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Search feature simple,So if I can remember it was creative commons. Okay so now I'm going to search in the full metadata exploration for the word license. Okay so it is creative commons. This one is the same license as the previous one.
1509,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Data table features useful,"The extreme values, I have to look at the values and they are down here somewhere. My sense is that there are slightly more red values up here than in the other. Oh well, there are more blues here and a similar amount of reds ... So this one here has more extreme values, which is Q1."
1510,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,I quite like the polar plot so let's go to Q2 and load the same plot.
1512,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Plot design complex,"I think it doesn't matter what I pick, which is a bit confusing."
1511,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"Surprise, surprise it is not so windy in Wexford, which is what I would expect as it is not in the west coast as Galway. One of the days prior to somebody getting their event there was a strong north-eastern wind, which is unusual. But yeah, I think I have done some comparisons there. Okay so I did a bit of that."
1513,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"No, I can't think of anything else other than maybe seeing trends. I suppose the plots on the other side are like the box plots, you would know but I don't know how you would do. There is no temporal aspect to it ... So you would not know when the interesting winds happen but if you had enough data you might see a pattern."
1514,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"Oh no, something struck me suddenly, I was assuming that the values out here were strong but now I am thinking they have something else. The colored tile is not stronger the more wind there is. Ah this is telling how much rain there was! So we have the rain, wind speed and direction."
1515,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Plot design complex,Okay I did not catch this the first time.
1516,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Visualization useful,"This is a very strong dry north-eastern windy day and this is a very strong rainy south day. I would not expect that all the rain would come from over here but I think it's fine. And here it was a calm, not very windy or rainy day."
1517,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Simple export,Okay I think that happened
1518,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Simple export,"The metadata file looks different but you probably cannot see my downloads. It is a ttl file for the metadata and a RDF file for the data, fair enough."
1519,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Task sequence complex,Ah yes I missed this one. (The participant reads the task again)
1520,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Simple export,I am going to try this here. There's an export button so I might just click that. Okay so I got a CSV file.
1521,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Navigation complex,The data might have an export button too. Oh here I missed that the first time.
1522,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Simple export,This one is taking a bit longer. So I have completed this now even though my computer is taking a bit to download the file.
1523,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Yes, I know the answer to this one. The data is obviously why we are doing this and the metadata I could open and have a look to see what's in there."
1524,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Navigation complex,"I don't know what happens if you click on a ttl file, it says what do you want to do with this and I don't know what I want to do with this. I will open it with the browser and see what it is. This is going beyond the task here but anyway. It is not offering me a browser."
1525,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Anyway, I believe this would be useful."
1526,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Overall positive experience,"Okay, so my first impression is that way better than the last time. I can't fully remember but I remember being confused and I found it difficult to connect what we were trying to do with what was going on in the dashboard. But I don't know why now but you probably remember."
1532,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Event concept and approach not clear,"It is certainly better, not perfect but ... Could somebody come into this that did not have my background information, which is considerable, make sense of it?"
1527,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Navigation complex,"So going back to a couple of things, I think that there's a little bit of confusion here how the starting of the time window and the end of the time window and how they relate to each other. It is slightly confusing that you can't see these things until you have checked for the data availability, and so kind of confused. Maybe you can add a note there, well there is a note that kind of implies it. But that was a little bit confusing to me."
1528,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Navigation complex,I didn't know that the queries were going to appear and still be there so I thought I was going to remember that. But of course like this it makes more sense but still it was a bit confusing.
1529,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Search feature simple,The searching thing that was not your fault it was just me being stupid.
1530,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Overall positive experience,They were the main things that caused me some trouble but otherwise I think it is great.
1531,P10_GMT20211130.odt,Navigation complex,I am sure there is a way to get rid of these things (referring to the metadata boxes) but I cannot see it at the moment. It will be quite nice because you need to keep remembering to scroll.

1538,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Task sequence complex,This first question refers to the home page I'm looking at at the moment right?
1539,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Additional explanation,"My only comment in this one would be for the link on the knowledge graph and methodology to be like a Wikipedia page., a simple page that describes semantic data integration framework with a simple definition of a knowledge graph. I guess just a simple definition."
1540,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Home tab elements useful,"But yeah it is really nice laid out, you can access, explore and export the data, which is quite clear."
1541,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Home tab elements useful,The visual is also quite helpful. You got an event with location and time and environmental data which is linked and then you have environmental data for a patient.
1542,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Task sequence complex,I have already done that.
1543,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Here in the query tab we got example events for Ireland.
1544,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Then in the events option we have possible, definite, no and high probability. I guess this refers to a disease event so yeah."
1545,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I will go for definite but it looks like you can select more than one option so I am going to select also high probability.
1546,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"The next option is the location which is like a county, so I will choose Cork."
1547,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"It looks again that I can choose more than one option like Cork, Dublin or Limerick. I will start with those."
1548,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: For this particular case, could you please choose less locations as we currently have a memory exceeding issue. A single location would be enough"
1549,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Oh yeah, sorry. I got excited there, okay. I will go for Dublin."
1552,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Time window length I will go for 4 days. So I am looking at events that happened in Dublin for a certain period and I want to see the lag. I will go for let's say a few days.

1550,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,Okay then you can go for the temporal unit you want. I will go for days okay.
1554,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I am provided with a case study of events in Ireland and I am interested in definite and high probable cases of events of this particular disease.
1553,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"I will be focusing on Dublin because this is sort of the major city, which is more likely to have a fair amount of cases."
1559,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Time window dates length, I chose a month because it is a rare disease so I think 30 days is more likely to help in these few cases."
1558,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,The lag period I am interested in happens in the weather characteristics and environmental conditions at least two weeks before the events.
1555,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query process clear,I got the information that there are two events and 20 data sets.
1556,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Then, I was given the option to choose the temporal unit, which I'm interested in days;"
1557,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,and then I want the mean aggregation.
1560,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Additional explanation,I would give some little extra information on what is envo data so a definition for that.
1561,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Additional explanation,"Then the time window length, so that it is fairly clear that you are interested in data for events for 30 days but does not show you what year or period the events are happening. And the time window lag seems clear. For each event that is aggregated, I am interested in the average of the last 15 days, and then of course the mean. So it is just the time window length, maybe you could even add information for these two (referring to length and lag)."
1563,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Then, events not sure I have clicked before. Information about the events that's clear with a definition for each of the events."

(The participant reads the rest of the data provenance table column headings) So it gives me a summary of what I have selected; and then, it gives the event, which is I think a total number of events. So it says eg:event-147 and then event type the one I have selected, high probability. Then, this is the county where it happened, Dublin. The event date shows you the period 2014 December the 10th and I assume these are the times in hours."
1573,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,It also shows you where the data is coming from. It is from EEA which I think is the European Union wide data set.

1577,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,So data lineage shows you some information about the technical links

1584,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"Oh okay, yeah. This assumes EEA and meteorological data, one for air pollution and one for meteorological data, so two data sets."
1587,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Task sequence complex,Would this ... okay. Would the data use comment be in this text?
1588,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Yes. If you want to read the first paragraph in this tab maybe it will help you. The introductory paragraph at the very top.

1605,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"Oh wow, these are nice plots. So this is a PM10 heat map where the low values are yellow going up to blue, which is high. Relative time from the event would be the lagged period. so you can see for the events: event-147, that around day 45 you would have high values of PM10; and for the event-347 it is towards days 20, 25 and 28 you see how high values of PM10. Okay this is very cool."
1606,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"The X-axis represents the concentration of the PM10 and the Y-axis the events. We got the median, the top and bottom as maximum and minimum. This has slightly higher values of PM10 compared to that one, that is cool."
1607,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,Oh nice. So we will look at wind speed and PM10 and wind direction. You can see that PM10 was higher when coming from the north-east and south-east. So generally towards the east there are high levels. The polar plot shows the wind speed at different ranges.
1608,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"Okay, that's cool. I get some sense of geographical pattern in PM10 exposure."
1609,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,Yeah this is great. I like this one and the heat map specially because it shows you from the time of the event the pattern in pollution levels.
1611,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"Yeah, so the heat map is really useful it shows the pattern, averaged for the time period selected and lagged days. The events that happen during this time you can see that there is a sort of lagged, increased levels of air pollution, prior to the events, which is quite informative itself."
1610,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"The polar plot gives you the patter I guess by direction, which is quite useful. I really like this plot."

If we could choose another time window, that would be great because there are currently 25 events. I can go let's say for this one, and reduce to 20 days the length and the lag. MODERATOR: Okay, great thanks. Very few environmental data sets but for this experiment it's fine. Mmmm maybe I choose something else, any advice? MODERATOR: Try Wexford as it has few events but enough environmental data. Okay, yeah this is fine."

1616,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: Maybe try another variable while I check if there is an issue. Try temperature please Oh yeah that's nice, don't worry. I can also compare the temperature from the previous query."
1637,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"So we got from the time of the event going back 20 days for that lag. These are events with a period of lower temperatures just the day before the diagnosis date but for the event. The 10th and 15th days are also periods with low temperatures, that's the main takeaway."
1636,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,I will check the box plot for temperature. Lower temperatures for these two and higher temperatures for those others.
1635,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,Polar plot. More events coming from the south-east okay.
1633,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,So if I compare this to the previous one ... Okay you can definitely see some differences between Wexford and Dublin for the selected events.

1638,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Yeah, I think this does the job. I would not add anything. Maybe ... I'm just thinking, a summary table ... Yeah actually the heat map and box plots do show you from an exploratory point of view. I don't know if this would be an extra or too much of an extra feature if you were to get a median or mean value at the time of the event. Yeah just median or mean at the time of the event with some of the summary of the polar plot."
1639,P11_GMT20211201.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"So that is just my comment. You get an overall raw data, then you can explore a summary, and explore the summary through a heat map and box plot, and then yeah.

Well I am looking a t Q2 that I have downloaded that has the event-32 and it was the first date that is the 19-10-2014 and then the dates go forward. Yeah so they go from October until November but you are not sure if those are lagged. So you are not sure when the event had happened. In my case, I was expecting something like October going back to September. But in this case it is probably that the event happened in November going back to October. So maybe a column with the lag that corresponds to the date as in the heat map. I think this would complete the lay out of the export."

1714,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Export (meta)data useful,So understand the column headings ... Okay. The column headings are fairly clear and you have the tool tip that appears underneath.
1715,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Data table features useful,"Now the cell background colors ... Mmmm ... What I am seeing here is that the cell background colors are red and blue, so obviously there's a Z-score calculated based on the 7 days of data here that uses I am assuming a standard deviation, which I am hoping is robust."
1716,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Navigation complex,"But what I am noticing, which looks a bit strange to me, is that the blue squares which indicate low scores have no data. They appear to be empty.

1717,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Navigation complex,"The red squares look reasonable enough but the blue squares I don't really understand.

1720,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"If I was looking at this as a modeler researcher modeling these events, what I would say is that you can highlight the red and the blue, which seem to be only calculated based on the data in the data table. So whether that is a good representation of your now very high values, that is not clear. So for example, if I am only looking for 3 weeks back and I look for high PM10 relative to those three weeks or should I be looking for high PM10 relative to a specific window back in time from the current point. So the standardization is useful to get the red and blue squares but I question whether the standardization should be done over a kind of a longer period. The idea of standardizing is to kind of use a pool of data that you think is reliable to standardize against. So I wonder about that I wonder as well about the empty, the empty blue squares and whether these values are missing or how they are actually treated right? For example, you can see an empty square here for Toluene, but that is not blue."
2335,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,I think the whole thing of looking for the comments in these using Control+F was more of an exercise to ... I don't know if anyone would want to do this in general but if so I am not sure for a user interface whether this kind of display code by default is actually quite necessary or helpful.
2336,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Export (meta)data useful,I mean an option to print the log out to file might be useful for someone that wanted to keep track of what they have searched for.

1727,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Visualization useful,I can see the usefulness of this. Again we are only looking at a week here but probably more useful if we were looking further than that.
1728,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I would imagine that those heat map colors are standardized based on only the things that are in the data table. It might be interesting to think about standardizing against a fixed amount of time, like standardizing it against all the days in the previous year or something like that. I know this is a challenging one to pick but if you were to take a week of PM2.5 for the winter and summer, something that flags as high in the week in the winter might be a lot lower that something that flags as high in the summer. Using the standardization of what is in the table."
1730,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Again, I wonder about standardization; it might make it a more useful plot if it was standardized."
1729,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I know that you got rid of the time series that you had in previous ones but ... yeah this one could be useful.
1733,P12_GMT20211206.odt,System issue,"I am going to pick something with a ... I will pick a period of 14 days ... Okay. (The participant selects different input options) Now, what I am going to do is check for the more extreme values, I am going to take the max for each day. Okay, it is thinking ... MODERATOR: Yeah, so we have a memory exceed problem. Oh yeah, I thought it would happen, apologies. MODERATOR: The problem is that Cork has 19 events and that is why you don't have Q2 appearing. If you could run another location with less events, like for example Wexford it should be fine. You won't have Q2 as this one is broken, but you will have Q3 on the top. Okay, yeah I see. Let's take a look. It is fine."

1735,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"So I am looking at the data provenance, well it looks like I have 5 events and it is using two data sets."

Interestingly there are less extreme values in this one (Q2) and I wonder why it would be. Actually, I have a different ... Oh, no maybe less pollution data here ... So I can't see PM10 and PM2.5 here, but I can see NO2."
1737,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional explanation,"Okay again, the max values the Z-scores we are looking at a large maximum based on what is on the table."
1739,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: Apologies, but since Q2 was broken the plots won't have the right index and you won't be able to compare the plots so feel free to skip this task."

1742,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional explanation,"I think maybe a little bit more detail on how the Z-scores are evaluated here just to how the cells are colored. I think that would be quite useful. Because I get the reason for using them but just yeah, I am not sure about just using the ones that are in the table."
1743,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Simple export,"Okay, Q1 ... (The participant exports the metadata and data files)"
1744,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Navigation complex,I am looking at the FAIR data which is a RDF file and the metadata is a ttl file.
1745,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Could you please confirm that you got a pop out window?
1746,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Simple export,"Yeah, I can confirm that I got a pop out window to download the files."

1748,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Export (meta)data useful,So it comes as a CSV file called Q1.csv and it has 17 rows of data and the various columns with dates involved. I am going to share this in a moment because I wanted to talk about the csv file I got from the download all option.
2337,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional explanation,"Yeah, so I would say it is good but there are some things that are not necessarily clear straight away. So again, maybe more sort of help in the tabs to help explain things, small things like the time window length and lag. These things might be clear for the use case, for people that are actually using these tools."
1750,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I mean one thing would be in the home menu, to add an extra tab called you know general directions, where you could just have a diagram showing the time window length and lag with a rough schematic to tell people of what they should be doing."
1753,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"The Z-scores can concede the intent of their usefulness but I would wonder about the general usefulness if it is only based on the data that is on the data table. That is because, if we could imagine, you know PM2.5 is probably much higher in the summer than in the winter. If we were to take a period of two weeks over the summer, then a high PM2.5 value over those two weeks would be very different from a high value of PM2.5 during two weeks in the winter; but both would be colored red with a high Z-score. They are not really as comparable as we might think initially, so better find a better data set to compute Z-scores against."
1754,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"Yeah, I did not fully grasp the data provenance and lineage bit, but I do not know much about SQL but I imagine that these are all very useful for actually keeping a hard record of the data search that was carried out and so on."

1755,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Visualization useful,I think the heat map plot was very nice to show a general profile of the pollutant over the time since the event.
1756,P12_GMT20211206.odt,System issue,I guess the RAM is not going to be an issue when this is up and running properly so I won't say much about that.
1758,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"So yeah, I think ... I suppose you can choose to view those things or not as I don't find them very useful myself, but you can kind of click on and off which is good (referring to the metadata displays)."
1757,P12_GMT20211206.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"So one thing that I mentioned previously is to be able to look at the patient level, to look for somebody that has two events for something, a time series of events. I think this is a bit challenging for this set up for how things are but ..."

1769,P13_GMT20211203.odt,Query process complex,"Time window length in days ... Does this mean the length of the follow up? Oh I don't know. It is a little weird for me this part, the time window length. It could have different meanings for different researchers, you know. For example, I think this is the follow up time for every patient. For me that would be the case and I will select 4 months."
1770,P13_GMT20211203.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Could you please reduce the value to a few days as I currently have a problem with the memory for this dashboard?

1884,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I can see that these are possible, definite, no or high probability flare events. From a researcher perspective it does not make a lot of sense to separate these out but irrespective I will choose definite and high probability. Generally, when we do research we combine these two groups."
1886,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,So we are going to look at the county now.
1887,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query process complex,Time window length ... I presume that means the interval to query.
1888,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I think this should be months rather than days. At least in my use case, it does not make sense to look at a day interval. But we can increase this to 44 days."
1859,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Would you mind selecting only a few days due to a memory problem I have with the current deployment of the dashboard?
1889,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Time window lag ... This is presumably looking at introducing a lag period of X amount of days. For a flare event, we might want to look at 10 days."
1890,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"Events and envo data sets, envo I guess it means environmental. This is not exactly clear, I would use the term environmental there."
1891,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query process clear,So there are 19 events and 4 data sets being buried.
1892,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,(The participant reads the temporal unit tool tip) I will pick days.
1894,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,We are asked to choose an aggregation method but of course the aggregation method depends on the variable under discussion. It will differ if we are talking about rainfall or whatever. I don't think you can apply an aggregation method to the overall data set.
1893,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"For the purposes of this we will choose min/max, this should be min and max. There is no rationale to choose min or max separately. These two should be combined."
1895,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"Particularly, I would use the term environmental instead of envo."
1896,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Event concept and approach not clear,I would add what is an event and what the event types mean. These were not very clear.
1896,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional explanation,I would add what is an event and what the event types mean. These were not very clear.
1897,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"Comprehend is a poor word there. Yeah, so this sentence needs to be rewritten as I don't really know what it means."
1898,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Maybe you can put a little information box to explain the meaning of data provenance and lineage. Perhaps, just put one beside each of these buttons to provide a bit more information. Particularly, these two on the left."
1899,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"So data table, I would separate those terms into data and table, not data table."
1900,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional explanation,So how do we know if data is normally distributed? Are we supposed to know this before we start? The assumption is that we know whether it is normally distributed. You might need something there to advise people about that.
1901,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,DateT I don't know what the T means ...
1860,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: Before exploring the data table, do you mind completing task 4 please?"
1902,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"So, again for usability all of these are in variable names in a database. Perhaps, these can have a more readable data label."
1903,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"I don't know what eg: means here, it implies you are providing an example of something. I presume each row represents an event, so if you would take out the eg: it would make sense."
1904,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,The numbers in the events are not clear what they represent ... Are they use case IDs? ... It is not clear what the number means but maybe it is not important.
1907,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"So we have 6 events here, it says that we have 19 here though ... Oh sorry, you can scroll down to the other events."
1906,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"These are the event dates. Given that this case study refers to patients, it would be important to know whether these events refer to separate patients or whether there are multiple events per individual. That is important from a statistical point of view."
1905,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"Again, in the data sets used the eg: does not make sense here. Data set EEA, I guess an expert user might understand what the names mean but I guess these are the data sets that describe the environmental data. So I guess it means something if you understand them."
1908,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,So that on first inspection seems to be the same. The data lineage and provenance seem to be the same ...
1861,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Every time you click a button a new area is displayed below.
1909,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional explanation,"Oh okay, so this needs to be improved with a little information button."
1910,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"What we are looking at here is like SPARQL code perhaps in RDF. I can see the query, so I would say it is the code underpinning the query. This would be useful for a technical user who wants to understand exactly how the data was generated."
1913,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,So interesting that the agents are represented as an ORCID. It will not be a bad wait to do it assuming that person has an ORCID. It might be useful.
1912,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,(The participant reads the full metadata text in detail showing interest in the content) Storing the data like this in RDF is nice.
1911,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"What we are missing here is the RDF for the event, how is that represented and linked to a patient. What the event and patients are in a standardized ontology."
1866,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,4 data sets.
1865,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Search feature simple,(The participant reads the data use comment)
1864,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Search feature simple,(The participant reads the identification risk comment)
1863,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Search feature simple,(The participant reads another description that i not the license)
1862,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: Would you mind reading right next to the text that has been highlighted in your text) Oh, okay that is the license: creative commons. This is good for reusability."
1914,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"I see we have a series of environmental pollutants, pollution data is empty apart from PM10. Otherwise, we would only have weather data."
1916,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"There are occasionally some pollution values. That may be because there is no daily data, which highlights the importance of using interpolated data."
1915,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Export (meta)data useful,(The participant reads the column heading descriptions) That is very nice.
1917,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional explanation,Some of the descriptions are missing or cut off so I am not sure if this is the end or not.
1918,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Data table features useful,So red means high values and blue low values based on a low and high Z-scores and assuming the data is normally distributed as advised above.
1919,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Data table features useful,That seems enough to do that. The eye icon is not really like an eye but I could guess it.
1920,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Yes, it is very useful assuming that the events that we are studying and the environmental variables displayed are relevant to the experimental question."
1921,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,"You are also listing here the events but it does not seem that all the events are listed here. Only a few of the events are listed, there were 19 events but only a few are displayed. It could be that there was no environmental data for it. I think that needs to be made clear."
1922,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I think you need to add a filtering based on the events in question. The rest I have discussed the features as I went along really.
1926,P14_GMT20220124.odt,System issue,"Okay so we can select from a list of variables here. I will choose PM2.5. I am going to get rid of this metadata thing first. MODERATOR: Could you please try another variable while I explore why PM2.5 is not working? It does not seem to be working? MODERATOR: What browser are you using? Firefox MODERATOR: Then, it should be fine. The box plot is working though MODERATOR: Let me restart one second. Could you refresh the website and submit another query please? Okay so I will login and submit another query. MODERATOR: I would advise to select a region with fewer data like Wexford. Sure, I would sort the locations alphabetically."
1923,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,I am going to get rid of this metadata thing first.
1867,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Could you please try another variable while I explore why PM2.5 is not working?
1868,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: What browser are you using?

1924,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,"Sure, I would sort the locations alphabetically."
1925,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query process clear,Data seems to be dependent on where you are looking.
1873,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Can you try temperature to see if the problem is the variable name selected?
1927,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,"So we have relative time from the event -10, okay. Now, I have all the events lined-up here. That is nice, you should be able to tell if there is a common environmental factor there within those ten days. Then, perhaps it would line-up and you can visualize that. This is the mean temperature reported."
1928,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,We could include some controls in another query.
1929,P14_GMT20220124.odt,System issue,"Did I break the query again? MODERATOR: It does not say anything in the log for now. There is another task, which is to run another query, so you won't have to do it again. I believe that if we stay with this amount of data we should be fine for the experiment."
1872,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: It does not say anything in the log for now. There is another task, which is to run another query, so you won't have to do it again. I believe that if we stay with this amount of data we should be fine for the experiment."
1933,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I think it would be very helpful in this heat map to define the category for this events, which are no and definite. To see if there is an effect in the occurrence of the event."
1932,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,"That is the rain, seems to be working better now."
1930,P14_GMT20220124.odt,System issue,"Let's try PM2.5 ... Well it does not like PM2.5. Let's try NO2, again not working. So it must be the pollution ones."
1931,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,There are some rainy days here and there.
1934,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,"You are displaying a lot of pop ups there which are not very clear. Oh yes, the median, min, max and the quartiles."
1936,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,"Okay, although we submitted a query with the mean you are displaying the data as a box plot. This allows you to infer the median. Okay, so this is the precipitation amount. However, it is not clear what it represents. Is it the amount over a period or a specific date? I am assuming it represents the median value for the whole observation period."
1935,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Plot design complex,"It also seems that there are more box plots that there are events, so one represents the mean and the other the median? It is not clear why there are more box plots. I think there are events in the Y-axis that are not displayed there. I think this is an issue with the size of the plot in the Y-axis."
1937,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,Very pretty but I am not sure what it means though.
1937,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Plot design complex,Very pretty but I am not sure what it means though.
1939,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Plot design complex,"We have north, east, south and west. We have presumably high and low rainfall but I don't see how this reflects or relates to the events that are occurring. It looks like it is reflecting wind speed also."
1938,P14_GMT20220124.odt,System issue,"If we go for temperature, it does not work but it works for PM2.5."
1940,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,So it shows an association between the wind direction and speed with the variable of interest.
1941,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional explanation,It is hard to understand and it definitely needs an explanation of what it means.
1942,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I think I would like a scatter plot as it is more transparent on the data you know.
1943,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Visualization useful,"The box plot is useful though to show the min, median and max."
1944,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Query process clear,I already did that. Easy to do.
1945,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"The first one used 4 data sets and this one uses 3. I can tell from the different variables presented to me that they are using different data sets, which is a big issue when you are comparing people across different areas."
1946,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Search feature simple,"Right, okay. It is just to go in here. This one has a creative commons license, which is the same as the other one."
1948,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,It is hard for me to say at the moment. I think to do that I would have to look at the data table.
1874,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: It is just more or less.
1947,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,Again you are kind of assuming that you can compare them side by side it was hard to remember what the other query was.
1949,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,"Let's look at rain and if I change this, does this automatically do it?"
1875,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: At the very top there are Q1 and Q2
1950,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Wording not clear,"I see okay, they are easy to compare there, I did not see Q1 and Q2. You can even call that query 1 and query 2 to make it more obvious."
1950,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,"I see okay, they are easy to compare there, I did not see Q1 and Q2. You can even call that query 1 and query 2 to make it more obvious."
1953,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Overall positive experience,It is very clear. With a few tweaks it is possible to explore the data quite nicely.
1952,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Export (meta)data useful,It always comes back to what the question is and for me it is not very relevant in vasculitis but it might be relevant to another environmental researcher.
1954,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Simple export,"Export the metadata and data, there it exports."
1955,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,"The FAIR data is saved as an XML file, which probably would be more accessible if you had a couple of options there like CSV. I will try anyway to see what comes out of this, yes it is an RDF file. So I presume I can open that with the browser. Okay, so I can explore that now."
1876,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Could you please complete the other sub tasks before moving on to the next task?
1956,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Task sequence complex,(The participant reads the sub tasks again)
1957,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Navigation complex,"This comes down as a file named data, which would be better if it is called data provenance as default even though I can change it."
1958,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Simple export,That is very straightforward.
1959,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Simple export,The data table itself. The CSV file which is again easily explorable which is easy to incorporate into an R script or something like that.
1959,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Export (meta)data useful,The data table itself. The CSV file which is again easily explorable which is easy to incorporate into an R script or something like that.

1961,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Yes, it would with the caveats I have described before, which is that a researcher will want to define their research question. They won't be interested in just exploring data. They want to be able to define the study and the events."
1961,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Yes, it would with the caveats I have described before, which is that a researcher will want to define their research question. They won't be interested in just exploring data. They want to be able to define the study and the events."
1962,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Presumably, from the location there should be an option to select all locations. In my case, I would like to get the data for all Ireland."
1964,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Overall positive experience,I think there are a few little things that can be tweaked and a few little bugs here and there but overall it is a very intuitive and easy to follow interface.
1965,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Overall positive experience,"So it is very nice, well done."
1966,P14_GMT20220124.odt,Export (meta)data useful,The visualizations are nice and the data tables are very clear.

We used to use this data to link with health data, so I think the parameters chosen are correct in this sense."
2009,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Let me check it ... Well here the NOx are not shown, which could be a problem in the data collection, but I think tit would help to complete the amount of environmental data that is necessary to link with health data."
2010,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Metals ... Sometimes the metal content, not one metal in particular for example the Nickel. Sometimes the metals are shown as a cluster, which is interesting to show."
2011,P15_GMT20211201.odt,System issue,I will check PM10 but I am not sure if it is working.

2016,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,It shows me the air temperature for a period before the event which includes 8 days before the event. The dark blue colors from the scale represent the high temperatures and the low temperatures are in a pale color.
2018,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"I will check another one, yeah. Let's see rain for instance. So it shows me the same graphic type which is the rain amount detected days before the event for each of the selected events. The plot has the same color scale for high and low values. I can understand the graphic very well."
2019,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,I think there are a lot of graphics shown here and I think it is enough information. I would not add any other parameters as I commented previously.

2022,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"This graph shows the amplitude of temperature for each event including the variance for each event. You can check if the event's temperatures overlay and for rain I guess it would be the same. Yeah, there are events with more dispersed data and other ones with less dispersion."
2023,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,I will check the same two parameters ... Oh this is nice.
2024,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"Here we have a graph that shows the mean temperature of each event but it adds a new parameter which is the wind speed and direction recorded for each event. It gives us a new perspective with more information, not only the temperature but it adds the wind speed and direction. The data is displayed in a wind rose, which is useful to detect the aggregated events, which is useful to detect if the events had a similar wind direction or speed. The scale of colors is used to represent the temperature of the air masses."
2025,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"For rain I think it is the same, well the dispersion of the rain is different than temperature but it aggregates the events in one mask of points. There is only an isolated point which is a bit different from the rest."

2031,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Data table features useful,Approximately the Q1 has more extreme events (referring to the data values).
2032,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,"One only, okay, so let's choose the heat map to compare the temperature from Q1 and Q2. Okay, here. I will do the same for the Q2 heat map. Oh, okay. The main difference is that there is a single event and in Q1 there are 19 events, which gives a different aspect to the graph. The rest of the representation is the same showing the mean temperature for the days before the case of study events. So the main difference is the number of events."

2043,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"Well, I think it is a good set of data, which is easy to work with. You can download the data so you can work with this data in different formats and programming languages like R or Python, which is very important."
2042,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Visualization useful,I think the general display of the data is very easy to understand. For me it is a good way to represent and show the data.
2042,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Overall positive experience,I think the general display of the data is very easy to understand. For me it is a good way to represent and show the data.

If I did not have these guides, it would have been more difficult for me to follow the instructions."
2046,P15_GMT20211201.odt,Overall positive experience,I think the second time that I have selected the events and data it was easier for me. You get used to the functioning of the application very easily. You get more confidence with the data distributions and buttons which is useful for me.
2047,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Home tab elements useful,It is quite clear in terms of its purpose.
2048,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Home tab elements useful,The language is very clear

2051,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Home tab elements useful,I don't think I would add anything really. There is no need to add anything necessarily.
2056,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Wording not clear,"I am looking at the figure to see how it adds value in many ways. There is a lot going on in this figure ... Mmmm ... Again there is R2RML that appears in the figure that has no link that I can see with the text, but RDF, SPARQL and FAIR are featured in the text."
2055,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Wording not clear,"So that would be kind of the considerations for me, this figure needs to be as simple as possible. I think it is overly complex for its needs."
2052,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Home tab elements useful,I haven't clicked on methodology or knowledge graph but I would probably do so. I must admit that I probably do not tend to.
2053,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Home tab elements useful,"Okay, it is taking me to a GitHub with lots of information. It is not necessarily a text page that I am going to, which explains the methodology, but it is the actual methodology."

2062,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I will pick Dublin because I want to focus on understanding the problem.
2063,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I can see I can pick multiple counties without any problem.
2064,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,The time window length in terms of days ... Okay so 14 and 7 days for the length and lag.

2131,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Navigation complex,"I don't think the eye ... I suppose it is a way of doing it faster, but if nobody notices it, it is just a bonus of being there until you have it explained somewhere. If it was explained my apologies as I did not see it."
2134,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Export (meta)data useful,The data table ... All I really learned from that is what information is in the table.
2135,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Data table features useful,"I guess I can see the Z-scores but it hasn't led me to any form of conclusions, so I wouldn't be hugely benefited from the distribution, the highs and lows, but it provides more understanding than a plain table."
2136,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,There is some benefit but I am curious now about the subsequent plots as more indicative pieces of information.
2133,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I am not seeing the value of this so much other than understanding the range of the information. The question is then: is this type of table the best way to present the data or this tab should be just a summary of metadata? That might be just as simple.
2138,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional explanation,"I think an explanation, questioning this data table. Just making sure everyone understands what is in the metadata file in terms of different criteria."
2137,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Data table features useful,Yeah the high lows. If this did not have the -2 and +2 this would be just a table. So I am more curious to get to the next plot.
2139,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Wording not clear,There is no need in my opinion to have the variables as short text because you have a long white tab here. There is no need to shorthand.
2139,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Plot design complex,There is no need in my opinion to have the variables as short text because you have a long white tab here. There is no need to shorthand.
2144,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,I'm going to go in the wind direction as there was not much data for the pollutants. Maybe for this event wind direction is a factor that would be interesting. I am changing the variable to O3.
2141,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Plot design complex,"There are four events where O3 data was available. I thought there were ten events so only four of them are available. I find that quite strange really. It is taking off the six events where O3 data was not available, but it does not come across here."
2140,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,That is straightforward in terms of understanding the events. The horizontal axis represents the number of days considering a lag in there as well. I am not sure how the lag affects it. Concentrations up to a 200. The heat map gives me something ... I am not sure how useful it is yet.
2143,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,"I am going for O3 too to add on the clarity for the variable. So here in the box plot I see all 10 events, which I appreciate more. I would appreciate that in the heat map as it provides a homogeneous, being able to click on and see."
2142,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"I include all of the events and if they are blank, leave them blank."
2145,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,"The 200 here appears again, there must be a reading that was extremely high for one of these days. There we go, there is a max that seems like a real outlier, bizarrely outlier."
2146,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,On my screen the blue is very hard to see until I hover over it but the hovering is quite good.
2147,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,"The hovering over does add some interesting value to that and the dots are spread across. Interestingly, the dots do not seem to align up the center of the box plot, they seem to lie below. It is definitely more informative than the previous one."
2148,P16_GMT20211215.odt,System issue,A little bit slower to load ... Okay.
2152,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Plot design complex,"This is a polar plot for O3. This I am not clear ... O3 concentration is linked to wind speed and direction., but I don't know the spatial or temporal units. Is it all 10 days of my data? I don't have any control over the day. Is it an event? There is no real breakdown or further breakdown here, which I think is necessary. This just provides me with a more holistic overview of Mayo for the whole thing."
2151,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Plot design complex,"Yeah, the box plot and the heat map provided more value than this one."
2150,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Plot design complex,"I am going to check rainfall. Yeah, not quite sure."
2149,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,There are no metrics here just to be clear. It could add more value if there were more drop downs or sub menus to break it down further.
2153,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"In terms of visualizations, there are improvements that can be made for them by having harmonized 10 events or clarity whether you can separate the events."

2154,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Task 7 refers to submitting another query on the left panel.
2163,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"So query, I am going to choose high probability and another location."
2156,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query process clear,"I will check availability ... 12 events and 3 data sets, fingers crossed."
2164,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"I will keep it daily ... Actually, hold on. Let's change to possible events to see if we could go hourly."
2157,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: If you would like hourly, I would advise Wexford as it has less data and events."
2165,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query process clear,"Okay, so Wexford. Let's check availability, 5 and 3."
2166,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,I am doing the mean.
2167,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"One thing I forgot in my assessment is that I was dealing with the maximum pressure and the maximum temperatures ... Rather than the mean, there was no flexibility to have mean and max there in the table."
2158,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Moderator comment,"MODERATOR: We got almost to the max memory permitted but I think it will work, please proceed to the next tasks."
2168,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query process clear,So we have Q1 with daily max values and Q2 with hourly mean values.
2169,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Mean as opposed to ... Mmmm ... Wind direction is not something that can be understood in a normal distribution just thinking about it. Again, this is another reason to understand if the normal distribution is not useful for some of these variables. I did not think about that before."
2170,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Know is an unusual metric you might want to convert that to m/s or km/h. I don't know why I'm only noticing this now.
2172,P16_GMT20211215.odt,System issue,The heat map is not working for the pollutants. I will try another variable.
2174,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,There is a lot more going on here as I have hourly values for 14 days.
2173,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Task sequence complex,I will go back to the questions before I continue here.
2175,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Task sequence complex,Q2 has more data as I went for possible events with hourly resolution.
2159,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: It refers to data sets used.
2176,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,"Ah, excuse me, data sets. There are much less data sets available for Q2. Data sets as opposed to data, which is unfortunate in many ways. But the higher resolution adds value."
2179,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Wording not clear,I am not clear about what license refers to.
2178,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Search information process complex,"Am I going back to data provenance? No, I am going to search in the data lineage. I honestly don't know but I think I would have to search for the meaning of that."
2177,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Search feature simple,"Okay, creative commons license."
2180,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"My question is, why do I need to know that as a user? More than anything ..."
2181,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Navigation complex,"In Q2 there are 70 pages, which I am not going to scroll across because that would take too much time. So I can give a guarantee of the information."
2182,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Data table features useful,"But based on the common wind directions not a fair representation. With hourly data you would assume that you would have more extreme values. Oh no because it is the mean excuse me, no. So the max actually would have the higher values. The finer resolution would give more extreme values but the daily max would give higher values. Hold on, in the sense that the extreme values are considered out of the 95% of the distribution then Q2. Oh yeah, complicated."
2183,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,I will choose the box plot because I found it the most informative for this one and compare the temperature.
2184,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Navigation complex,"I will go back to Q1 and also select the temperature for the box plot. So 5 events in this one vs 10 in that other one. Comparing is fine but I am clicking between tabs, which makes it a little bit tricky. One thing to notice is that the mean max is different so comparing tab to tab is not the most effective because the magnitude scales are different. Mentally I need to convert them to the same scale to effectively compare. There is much more variety so I don't know if it is a fair comparison."
2185,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Visualization useful,"This is max daily Q1 so I would expect a higher maximum and more variety more distributed, while this one which is Q2 that represents the mean hourly data with more harmonized results. I think I changed too many variables to make a fair comparison."
2160,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Don't worry it is fine.
2188,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query process clear,"Again, I changed a lot of variables but going back to the queries that stayed. I would probably not be as extreme in my changes. I made too many changes. Therefore, after an iteration I would have a better way of comparing."
2187,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"However, things that have 0-20 and 0-25 scale would be good to convert it to the same scale to avoid any sort of misinterpretation."
2186,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Export (meta)data useful,But this is an informative step in the analysis and you would be anyway downloading the data to assess it.
2189,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"If you could have scales or be able to show the two side by side, split the screen or the window to allow that. That would be extremely helpful."
2190,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Maybe rather than hovering over to get the x-value in the box plot, to have the value displayed somehow for the box plot metrics. The information when hovering over offers a great value but really I am just trying to get the actual number or get rid of the y-axis information in either or both."
2192,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Simple export,I go to the button FAIR metadata export.
2161,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: No need to save it if you don't want to.
2191,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Simple export,"Okay, and then I click on FAIR data export. So by clicking on it, it automatically allows me to export."
2193,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Task sequence complex,So I got a table ... What is the data table? Is that the data table?
2162,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: The actual data table that you see there.
2194,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Navigation complex,"Ah this one, okay. I am just jumping down here."
2195,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Simple export,There is an export there. It downloads the data as a CSV.
2196,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Navigation complex,"Going back to the FAIR data, it is a .ttl file. So the FAIR metadata is a RDF file. So there is a wide range of formats that we are dealing with here."
2197,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,So one thing I would include here is that you can tick on the types of files that you want.
2198,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Wording not clear,"What we are talking about here is that you have used the word download while previously the word export seems to be the common language on the other two tabs and buttons. I know they are the same thing but again, harmonized language and having to go to multiple locations ..."
2199,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Do you really need to go to different locations to download the files? Maybe this tab is like downloadable information and all the buttons can be inside with selects.
2201,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Navigation complex,For me the two buttons for the FAIR (meta)data exports are two buttons that I would not have here. So the other three are fine but those too are just dropped here. If anything is just for export. I just don't feel that they fit.
2200,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Navigation complex,"Then, the data table and the data provenance ... In the data provenance table, only when I click there I can find the export button."
2202,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Data table has it here. Harmonizing this information would be useful, maybe in this download area you could have a clear link to download information. If you open a tab Q1 and Q2 inside the download area, where you can have an expandable/contracting menu for the queries to download the files. So I don't know."
2203,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Wording not clear,Download query should download data tables because you are only downloading the data tables. Maybe it's my language.
2204,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Query process complex,"Obviously, reckoning the constraints is feasible for the present system, which allows/restricts some way of querying. I suppose that for me I was overly adventurous changing files and then, considering that I was going to compare Q1 and Q2. They were not as easily comparable as I would have liked."
2206,P16_GMT20211215.odt,Event concept and approach not clear,"The possible description again needs clarification for the events, I know that there is a button but again, I am not sure what an agent means. From my perspective, definite, possible and high probability mean in a statistical sense so like you know greater than 90%. Again, maybe because I am coming at it not from a rare disease angle. I would like clarification on what that is rather than saying by an agent."

2272,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: This is a mistake from my side. The -1 should be -5 as I forgot to add the lag there.
2276,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Visualization useful,"I see okay. The relative time from the event that means the lag you selected in the query, right? I understand that it should be this."
2282,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Plot design complex,I don't understand what is the plot underneath the heat map though.
2277,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Visualization useful,"Let's try another variable like rain. Okay, so millimeters I see ..."
2283,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Plot design complex,"I understand that the plot underneath is a subset of the database, that is what is denoted by these bars because the patterns tend to represent this."
2281,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Visualization useful,Relative time from the event locates the event in time and the rainfall.
2278,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Just to suggest more work, I would like a way to assess the significance of the pattern. Not the significance of the individual values but of the overall selection of events like here with regard to the entire database. I don't know if this makes sense or not. Just to make an assessment of how relevant the query is but maybe this is not useful."
2279,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Visualization useful,"Okay, nice. I see this is very useful."
2280,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"The events might be in different seasons and we know that there is a seasonality in temperature. I don't know if you removed the seasonality in temperature but in any case you can showcase in a different color the different seasons. Maybe these values are anomalies and the seasonality is already removed. In this case, information of whether these are anomalies or individual values would be useful but they seem individual values. I think yeah an indication of the season would be useful."
2284,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Visualization useful,"Nice plot. Okay that is a typical polar plot I think. This is relevant. It displays all the events, which is nice."
2285,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Visualization useful,I don't know if it makes any sense from the query I made but yeah it can be informative.
2286,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Well, you know I am keen on the time series data. I think that time series represents well whether your points are anomalies. If you could make a time series representation and highlight the anomalies with a different symbol or color. Then, we would have an image of how far these values are from normal range values, these outliers."
2287,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"What I mean is that in the type of representation that you have with each section of the heat map and here at the bottom plot of the heat map you have the representation of the database. If I am correct, because I don't know if I am. Here you have a visual understanding of the comparison between the selection of events and the overall dimension or parameter space of this variable. You don't have this on the box plot because you cannot compare how relevant it is in the overall behavior and variability, and the same for the polar plot."

2294,P17_GMT20211216.odt,System issue,"Oh wow! I see that now the dashboard is computing. I imagine I will have to displace, maybe not."
2290,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: The system has a problem regarding the memory being exceeded so I would like to ask you if you could refresh the dashboard and submit another two queries please.
2295,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Moderator comment,MODERATOR: Could we select a location with fewer events so we avoid the memory problem?
2298,P17_GMT20211216.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,"Okay, okay. So I will change the location for the second query. The former query is kept in the memory, okay."
