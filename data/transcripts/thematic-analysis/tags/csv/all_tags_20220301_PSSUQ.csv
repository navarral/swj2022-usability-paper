2338,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Navigation complex,Adding in multiple counties for queries is somewhat cumbersome
2339,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,but otherwise very good
2340,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,It took me a while to understand the data lineage and metadata info but that's probably mostly due to my own ignorance
2341,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Visualization useful,"Nice interface, graphics presented very nicely"
2342,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Task sequence complex,"While it was easy, I wonder if it would have been as simple without the task sheet to guide me. For example, I may not have noticed the ""download all"" tab."

2343,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Export (meta)data useful,"For my specific purposes, it's probably easier for me to just get a complete dump of the stitched event/environmental data."
2344,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Visualization useful,"But I can certainly see how this would be useful for other research purposes, especially non-stats people who may not know how to make their own effective data visualisations."
2345,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Data table features useful,"The only mistake I think I made was accidentally removing a column when I didn't need to, but I think I quickly figured out how to add it back"
2346,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,There was a lot of information and not all of it was relevant to me.
2347,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Data table features useful,But I think it's a good idea that it's there. The information that was relevant to me was mostly clear.

2349,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,Mostly very well laid out.
2350,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,The data provenance/data lineage/ metadata tables confused me at first.
2351,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I think time series plots and histograms would be good additions
2352,P1_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,"Some small gripes here and there, but mostly it seems like a very well made system"
2353,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,I missed some things on the screen but that could have been because it was a first use and I was being observed. Once I spotted the features they were easy to use.

2358,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,I was looking forward to seeing the data appear and to investigate it. The interface didn't get in the way of that interest.
2359,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,The interface is intuitive
2360,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Navigation complex,Sometimes I didn't notice the help information.
2361,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Some more icons on the graphs could have been useful.
2362,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Data table features useful,The tabular data was easier to understand as it had more labels.
2363,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Navigation complex,I wasn't sure why I had 5 buttons below the information on the right hand side of the screen.
2364,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,Yes it was clear and not fussy. The only part that was a little difficult to interpret was all the text about the meta data. This data is essential to have but could have been summarised carefully using icons
2364,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,Yes it was clear and not fussy. The only part that was a little difficult to interpret was all the text about the meta data. This data is essential to have but could have been summarised carefully using icons
2365,P2_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I would have liked a way to compare or combine the visual results of the queries. At least to view them side by side.

2369,P4_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional explanation,"In some cases, when the queries don't get available data, or the plots become buggy, the error messages could be clearer."
2370,P4_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional explanation,"In general it's really clear, but as already mentioned, some of the terms/plots could be more explained."
2371,P4_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"All the metadata stuff isn't 'hard', but in general I would not classify it as 'easy' either."
2372,P4_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"It does, but I already made some suggestions on potential additions."
2373,P5_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,System issue,Memory issues weren't reported
2374,P5_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Query inputs and elements useful,but the information about queries was informative
2375,P6_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Wording not clear,Some technical terms not so easy to understand
2376,P6_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,I suppose is as simply as possible due to the complexity of the subject
2377,P6_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Task sequence complex,needed some time to adapt...
2377,P6_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Navigation complex,needed some time to adapt...

2386,P9_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Visualization useful,I liked the tables and box plots very much
2387,P9_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Query process complex,"Selecting number of days and data frequency was confusing, I would add more info there (I initially selected something that made no sense at all, perhaps the system should have warned me or not let me do it)."
2388,P9_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional explanation,"Yes, just more information is needed."
2389,P10_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Query process complex,It's complex stuff so hard to be very easy to use
2390,P10_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Query process complex,I wasn't totally effective at the first attempt.
2390,P10_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Navigation complex,I wasn't totally effective at the first attempt.
2391,P10_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional explanation,"I got very few error messages, if any"
2392,P10_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"The provenance, lineage and metadata sections had me very confused."
2393,P11_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Fewer details under the data provenance, lineage could help improve the understanding of data source, licence, etc."
2393,P11_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content not useful or confusing,"Fewer details under the data provenance, lineage could help improve the understanding of data source, licence, etc."

2395,P12_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Navigation complex,Some concerns over z scores especially related to missing data areas in data table
2396,P12_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Task sequence complex,This was more related to the tasks
2397,P12_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional explanation,Time and time lag needs more information
2397,P12_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Query process complex,Time and time lag needs more information
2398,P12_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,It would be good to see multiple events for a patient over time. Z scores are not easily interpretable.
2399,P13_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,The explanations are written to make it easy to use.
2400,P13_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,It would be better if it included clinical information.
2401,P14_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Metadata content clear and useful,Exploring the data and metadata was easy
2402,P14_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Event concept and approach not clear,understanding how it relates to the underlying research question is less so.

2406,P16_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,It can be simplified through more clarifications and perhaps less information in some locations.
2407,P16_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Overall positive experience,"The guidance was required, but yes."
2408,P16_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,"Things can be improved, as discussed in the session."

2416,P17_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Task sequence complex,"I hadn't read the explanations previous to the experiment, but should have completed them efficiently."
2417,P17_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Event concept and approach not clear,I feel I somehow lack the reference time series of the environmental variable selected with the display of the events selected by the query.
2417,P17_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I feel I somehow lack the reference time series of the environmental variable selected with the display of the events selected by the query.
2418,P17_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,I feel neutral about this question yet as I would need to see it applied to a real case of my interest. Maybe.
2419,P17_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,System issue,"No error messages other than those derived from the use of a free software by the developer, therefore having to clean the memory for resources."
2420,P17_Nov21_PSSUQ_Comments.odt,Additional feature suggestion,A time series plot.
