For example, I may not have noticed the ""download all"" tab.",3,"For my specific purposes, it's probably easier for me to just get a complete dump of the stitched event/environmental data. But I can certainly see how this would be useful for other research purposes, especially non-stats people who may not know how to make their own effective data visualisations.",4,NA - I don't believe I encountered any errors.,1,"The only mistake I think I made was accidentaly removing a column when I didn't need to, but I think I quickly figured out how to add it back",3,There was a lot of information and not all of it was relevant to me. But I think it's a good idea that it's there. The information that was relevant to me was mostly clear.,2,"Some tooltips missing. Wasn't entirely sure what ""time lag"" meant.",2,Same as above.,1,No issues,2,Mostly very well laid out.

11/19/2021 11:59:24,P2,2,I missed some things on the screen but that could have been because t was a first use and I was being observed. Once I spotted the features they were easy to use.,2,It was much more simple than having to create queries using the current query interfaces.,1,I finished all tasks within a reasonable timeframe.,3,I was quicker for the second query. I would be quicker if I was to do it regularly.,2,I was able to explore the interface efficiently. Even if I choose an incorrect option I was able to get back on track.,1,I was looking forward to seeing the data appear and to investigate it. The interface didnt get in the way of that interest.,1,,1,,4,,2,The interface is intuitive,2,,4,Sometimes I didnt notice the help information.,3,Some more icons on the graphs could have been useful. The tabular data was easier to understand as it had more labels.,3,,3,I wasnt sure why I had 5 buttons below the information on the right hand side of the screen.,2,Yes it was clear and not fussy. The only part that was a little difficult to interpret was all the text about the meta data. This data is essential to have but could have been summarised carefully using icons,2,The interface was interesting to explore. I wanted to see what all the buttons and options did.,3,I would have liked a way to compare or combine the visual results of the queries. At least to view them side by side.,2,
