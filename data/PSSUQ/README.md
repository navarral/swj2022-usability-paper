meant to assess the usability evolution during the development of a system.

The scores from the PSSUQ are in the `scores/` folder. The folder contains the PSSUQ scores for the Phase 1 (P1) and Phase 2 (P2) to generate Figure 3D and 4.

The open comments from the participants are in the `comments` folder.
